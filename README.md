# Braille-Display-CAD

Experimental design for a braille display using build123d CAD in Python

## BOM

* M2 bolts
* 4mm x 8mm DC Motors: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004370822475.html
* 603zz Ball Bearing (3x9x5mm): https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003067718206.html

## Ideas

* Investigate bi-metallic strip with actuator.
* Investigate shape memory alloy (SMA) approach. Benefit: Would be very quiet.
* Should buy some 4mm solenoids
* Instead of rack and pinion mask, what about laser printer fuser-like roller mask?
* Key and lock mechanism pushes up on the pins
